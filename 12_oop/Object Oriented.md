Js and classes

- JS is prototype based language and it's classes are syntatic sugar over existing prototype based inheritable mechanism 
- Object -> collection of properties and methods like toLowerCase()

- why we use oops 

- parts of oops 

Object literal 
- constructor function 
- prototypes 
- classes 
- instances (new, this)

4 pillers
- Abstraction - Hiding details 
- Encapsulation - wrapping up data 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 

what happens when you use new keyword :

1. new keyword - creates a empty object which is called as instance 

2. construction function is called because of this new keyword

3. this keyword injects / passes arguments into it 
4. provided in function to be used 
construction is a reference to itself
