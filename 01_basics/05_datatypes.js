/*
datatypes 

- primitive -> call by value change occure in copy 

    types : string, number, bool, null, undefined, symbol (to make anything unique used for a component), Bigint

- reference (Non primitives) - ref in memory is directly allocated
    
    array, objects , functions
    to master js - master objects and brower events or web events master these 

    array
        const hero = ["ironman","hulk","cap","thor"]

    objects 
    let myObjects = 
        {
            name: "anant",
            age:23,

        }
    
    function
    const myFunction =
        function(){}
    return type of function is << object function >>

Return type of variables in JavaScript 
1) Primitive Datatypes        
    Number => number        
    String  => string        
    Boolean  => boolean        
    null  => object        
    undefined  =>  undefined        
    Symbol  =>  symbol        
    BigInt  =>  bigint 

2) Non-primitive Datatypes        
    Arrays  =>  object        
    Function  =>  function        
    Object  =>  object
