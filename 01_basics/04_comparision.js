// TS provides you with extra strict rules to work with datatypes
// TS doesn't allow you two compare two different datatypes
// two comparision entites must contain same data type

// console.log("2" > 1);

// In js we do not get predictable results we often get some different rusults

// In js comparision and equality operators work differently
